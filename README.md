# SBuCa

### Overview
**SBuCa** stands for Smart Business card and it's a card-sized, e-ink based, embedded platform.

### Goals of the project

Its high-level goal is to provide a reference platform for e-ink based display applications and there's nothing better than a business card for that!

Other than that, these are the main goals:

* Completely open source
* Vertical: everything has to be done in house
* Easy to carry along (it's a business card)
* Energy efficient: it's powered by two CR-2032

Everything in **SBuCa is open source**, starting with its hardware design: schematics and layout are provided along with the whole KiCad project, including eventual custom footprints.

### Cumae: SBuCa's proto-OS/firmware
As already pointed out, one of the non-functional goals of SBuCa, since its inception, was to come up with something vertical, meaning that everything had to be done from scratch, even its OS/firmware.

This goal has been achieved by **Cumae**, the proto-OS SBuCa is currently running.

Cumae, like everything else here, is totally open source and can be found on [its own repository](github.com/michelangelo/Cumae).
